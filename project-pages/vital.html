          <div class="body-text">Physicians are inundated daily with new research, drug approvals, and policy updates. Many spend hours reviewing medical literature to ensure they’re giving patients the most current care, but most simply can’t keep up. This information overload leads to inefficiency and outdated treatment plans. Our team set out to build a tool that automatically digests the world’s latest medical evidence and helps clinicians see, in real time, which of their patients are affected by those changes. We wanted to turn information overload into actionable insight.</div>
          <div class="body-text">Vital AI is an agentic workflow platform that continuously monitors the medical landscape. It integrates with Impiricus’ Research Stream, processes new studies and policy updates through OpenAI models, and uses Supabase to match findings to patient data. Physicians see a real-time dashboard highlighting which patients are impacted by new evidence, alongside auto-generated summaries and explainers they can use in discussions. Cedar-OS “spells” add intuitive right-click actions, allowing clinicians to quickly match patients, generate reports, or draft messages without leaving the dashboard. The interface is built with Next.js, Tailwind/shadcn UI, and a drag-and-drop canvas for interactive patient grouping.</div>
